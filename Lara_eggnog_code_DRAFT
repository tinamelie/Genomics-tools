#Use these commands to process all your output files from eggnog. This assumes that they are all in the same folder and named {species}.emapper.annotations

# When all the files have been processed, run part two in the folder to combine all of the counts into one file.

# Part 2: 

# Once all the files have been processed, run this in their folder. This will process all files ending with .trim in the folder and create one file which includes the values from each file. 

# Make sure you have sourced ~/.hmmer for csvtk to work

source ~/.hmmer

# Convert *.out files to tab-delimited
ls *.out | parallel 'csvtk space2tab {} > {.}.tsv'

#Ignore - this probably isn't needed: sort the contents of all the .tsv files in your directory
#for file in *.tsv;
 # do 
#sort  < ${file} > ${file}_sorted; done

#get the names of your files
echo $(dir)

# get unique ids for columns. IMPORTANT!!!!! check if anything is weird!!!!!!!

cut -f 1 *.tsv | sort | uniq | tee columnkey.txt

#You'll paste the output from echo $(dir) for the file names.
# This will join all files and replace blanks with 0s. Make sure column key is first in the order before all other file names. 

csvtk join -t -k columnkey.txt file1 file2 --na 0 |

# Flip so species names are headers
tac > all_COG_count.tsv

#  convert to csv - possibly better for R?
csvtk tab2csv all_COG_count.tsv > all_COG_count.csv
