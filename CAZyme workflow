## Purpose: Identify, filter, and count CAZyme families and subfamilies from a protein fasta.
#

1. Find CAZymes with coverage > 0.45 and e-value <1e-17 from proteins.fasta file using HMMER - these parameters are suggested for fungi. This takes about 3-5 hours depending on CAZy content. I'm not sure multiple nodes/tasks if you're running a slurm really helps.

```
source ~/.hmmer
run_dbcan.py --out_pre yourspecies --hmm_cov 0.45 --hmm_eval 1e-17 --hmm_cpu 12 --db_dir /pl/active/fungi1/dbcan_db/ yourinputfile.proteins.fa protein
```

2. Remove header line
```
tail -n +2 hmmer.out > hmmer_step1.out
```
